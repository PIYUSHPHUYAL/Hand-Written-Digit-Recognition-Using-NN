# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-Using-NN (Neural Network)

This project implements a neural network model for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The neural network architecture includes an input layer, a hidden layer with 100 units, and an output layer for 10 classes (digits 0-9). The model utilizes the sigmoid activation function and incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting.

## Features:
- **Training and Testing:** The dataset is split into 60,000 training examples and 10,000 testing examples.
- **Implementation:** Python code using NumPy and SciPy for matrix operations and optimization.
- **GUI Integration:** Includes a GUI component for drawing digits and predicting their values using the trained neural network.

## Setup:
- Ensure Python and required libraries are installed.
- Download the MNIST dataset.
- Run `Main.py` to train the model and save trained parameters.
- Use `GUI.py` for handwritten digit input and prediction.
